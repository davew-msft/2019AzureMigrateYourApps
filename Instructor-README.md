# Microsoft Azure Training Day: Migrating Applications to the Cloud.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Migrating Applications to the Cloud Training.  This page will give you all the information you need to know in order to execute a successful event.  The first half of the day is based on a story.  That is a story based on Tailwind Traders.

The story goes that, Tailwind Traders acquired Northwind Traders earlier this year, they wanted to be sure that they could access their inventory in real time, which meant moving their existing web API alongside ours on Microsoft Azure.   Besides moving the local web aps and API's to Azure there is a need to move the On-Premise MongoDB and SQL Server to the cloud as well.

## Presentations 

The readme in the presentation folder will give you an update as to when that presentation was last validated.  Please check the date and augment as necessary to be accurate.  There are five presentations to match the five informational sessions in the agenda.  See the below section on Session Notes for more details on each of those.

AzureLabSetup.PPTX - There is a presentation to use as a template to display for the class for you to put up your WiFi information.   There is also a place to advertise the Azure lab setup URL and Access Code.  Secondary slides show screenshots of what you will get when singing up for a lab.

## Labs 

The lab folders are self contained labs.  You should not need to go to other resources to run the labs.  Attendee's will need a laptop, but only an Azure browser is required.  All work will be done in the portal and the Azure Comannd Shell.  If you think attendee's laptops may be locked down to the point that they can't access Azure, than having a laptop for loan will be a good idea.  No special software needs to be installed though. 


The original code base of the database and application migration labs are from these events.

## Setupfiles

You should not need to do anything with the setup files.  There is a backup file for SQL that is used during the database migration lab.  There is also a MongoDB backup in case you need to create your own MongoDB server.  See notes about that in Session 3.

## Azure Environments

You can do all these labs in your own environment, but for the scheduled marketing classes youwill have lab environment provisioned by a partner.  

1. You will get a unique link and activation code for your event in email
2. You will give the link and code to the students and they will all sign up for a lab in the beginning of the session
3. There is a PPT in the presentations folder that you can use to show students the information to connect.
4. The labs will all have three resource groups as follows
   1.  RC1 - Empty and used to create all assets for Lab 1 and Lab 2.  Please direct students accordingly.
   2. RG2 - Contains a SQL VM.  This can be used as the OnPrem SQL VM for Lab 2.  Use it to either save time of creating a VM or if Azure is slow to create VM's for some reason.  Depending on your audience it may be worth them creating it for the experience.  For others may be just time consuming.  Your call as to use this or not.  It is basically a backup.
   3. RG3 - Resources for the DevOps Lab 3.  
5. Participants will land on a page with login information for the SQL VM as well as the Service Principal needed for Lab 3.  Make sure they save this info or that they also received the email with this in it.
6. **<u>SUPPORT:</u>** If you have any issues during your event with a pre-provisioned environment please email cloudlabs-support@spektrasystems.com.  There is a 15 min response SLA.

## Demo Setup

You Lab 1 and 2 together create a demo that shows an application migrated to the cloud.  You should create a finished environment so you can show the end result during session 1.  You have two choices to get an environment up and running:

1. Run though the labs yourself and in the end you should have the full demo
2. You can use this [IgniteTheTour-DEV10](https://github.com/microsoft/IgniteTheTour/tree/master/DEV%20-%20Building%20your%20Applications%20for%20the%20Cloud/DEV10) repo and deploy the deployment/deploy.sh script.  Please use the Azure Bash shell as you know it has all the dependencies.   That should create a fully working environment.

  - This lab is not connected to the source code from the previous lab.  It is complete independent and different.  Due to time we could not create a lab based on the previous code base, so this was reused from another training session.
- This will require a service principal.  This service principal is all ready setup and the students have it in their email and on the lab landing page they got after signing up for the lab environment.
  
  

### Appendix A - Create a Linux MongoDB

If you need a MongoDB to perform Lab 3.  Follow these steps:

1. In Azure press create new resource and type 'MongoDB'
2. Create a VM based on one of the MongoDB templates. 
   1. This session used the one by Jetware
3. Set it's IP address to static
4. Make sure two firewall ports are open for
   1. SSH - 22
   2. MongoDB - 27017
5. Once Created SSH to the VM 
6. Install the MongoDB client tools 
   1. sudo apt install mongo-clients
7. Download the inventory.bson and inventory.metadata.json using wget
8. Restore the database using mongorestore command
9. Create the user in the lab
   1. At the linux prompt type 'mongo'
   2. db.createUser({user: "labuser", pwd:"AzureMigrateTraining2019#", roles:[{role: "read", db:"tailwind"}]})
